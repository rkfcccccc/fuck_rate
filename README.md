# Fuck rate telegram bot

Counts the rate of "fuck" (or "fukc", "fukkkkkccccc", "fuuuuuuuck", "fuccccccckkkkkk" and others) messages in your telegram chats.

## Getting it work
To make the bot work, you must specify `API_TOKEN` in your `.env` file.

Also, you can use some scripts to speed up deploying:
1. Build Dockerfile with `./script/build`
2. Run container (named as fuck_rate) with `./script/build`
3. Stop and remove container with `./script/down`
